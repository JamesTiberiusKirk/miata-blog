Meet Mia, my 1997 Mazda MX-5 NA.  
This site will be a place to document the mods and fixes on my mx-5 na (mk1) from 1997.

## The Idea
I would like to begin with a brief definition of the term _*'engineering'*_.

> Engineering is the application of modern sciences AND mathematics to solve problems.  


Since I was a child I have been taking apart everything and anything my parents would let me,
learning how they work and trying to fix it (more often than not just trying to remember how
to put it together).
Because of computers and video games, I have ended up going down the software engineering route
and that is my career.   


Not too long ago I have passed the driving test and bought my first car, a VW Polo from 2017 with
a 1.2l engine. And as much as I love that car, I also recognise the fact that that it just is not
designed like they used to be back when they were still referred to as the _*'peoples' car'*_, in
fact no car is.


The reality of the situation is that most cars nowadays are made like smartphones.
1. With planned obsolescence 
2. With obstruction of repairability


As a quick example, VW did not even provide me with a full list of the fuses in the fuse box.
When the wiper fluid pump stopped working (which turns out is a common failure) I was not able
to just open up the manual and replace the fuse. I had to look online on forums which yielded 
two possible answers, which then I was able to confirm at our local Halfords (automotive parts
chain store in the UK) which they had a mechanic's manual in their computer system.


And this is just one small example of how car manufacturers make it as hard as possible for
someone to service their own car.


So what actually is my plan?  

I want to learn a car the same way I learned computers. By using one which allows me to tinker
with it and modify them. An older, _*more raw*_ car will allow me to do that.

## The Car
Mia is a 1.8L Harvard edition Mazda MX-5 NA model from 1997.  


Fun fact, my Harvard edition is currently one of 148 other Harvard edition mx-5s which are
currently on the road in the UK. Fact provided by [How Many Left](https://www.howmanyleft.co.uk/vehicle/mazda_mx-5_harvard)
which is a compilation of publicly available data from DVLA.  


I specifically wanted a first generation mx-5 because of the following reasons.
1. They are very light cars, which in turn make it more fun to drive as less power is needed.
2. Rear wheel drive. If you are buying a car for fun you need RWD.
3. Convertible. What better way to enjoy the few sunny days we get in Britain than by putting
that roof down?
4. Pop up headlights. This is just a no-brainer.
5. Price, at the moment these cars in UK go for anywhere between £2k and £7k depending on
modifications and condition.
6. This car was simply designed to be blank slate which you can do whatever you want to it
    - Plenty of space in the engine bay
    - Solid base engine 
    - Generally very serviceable
7. The MX-5 modding community is probably the biggest one
    - UK's Japfest is like 70-80% compromised from MX-5s
8. On paper its a JDM (because it's Mazda), and for me thats enough :)
    - It was actually created/designed by Bob Hall (an american) in California
    - One of the biggest inspirations for the miata was the Lotus Elan, a British car
