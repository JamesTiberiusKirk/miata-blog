In this post I will be listing and keeping the list up to date (hopefully) of all of the tools and aids which I will be using for working on the car.

## Jacking the car up:

[Halfords 5 piece lifting kit](https://www.halfords.com/tools/garage-workshop/axle-stands-trolley-jacks/halfords-5-piece-lifting-kit-657230.html) 

I was actually struggling to lift my mx5 up with just this as there aren't made good spots underneath the car to lift it from and the jack itself does not go that high up.

## Tool set: 
For now, I've bought this cheap set of ratchets from [amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/WORKPRO-Socket-Release-Ratchet-Mechanic/dp/B07B8Y1SNC)

When it comes to spanners, I have random pieces from working on bicycles over the years.

### HOWEVER
What I actually want to get, but for now its completely unnecessary and 4x the price of the kit above. Therefore could not justify it to myself for now.

It's the [150 piece set](https://www.halfords.com/tools/hand-tools/socket-sets/halfords-advanced-150-pc-socket-and-spanner-set-735906.html) or ratchets and spanners from Halfords Advanced brand.

The reason why I want this set is simply because it should be everything I ever need and Halfords Advanced brand has lifetime warranty... also in person it looks very pretty ðŸ‘€.


## Other standard tools and consumables

Other things wish I have and are useful are the following: 
- Electrical and duct tape
- Blue roll (always useful as u might need to check oil levels, or if leaks happen, or if rain leaks in, etc...)
- A cheap ratcheting screwdriver kit
- Some form of knife/box cutter
- Zip ties
