## Jacking the car up:

[Halfords 5 piece lifting kit](https://www.halfords.com/tools/garage-workshop/axle-stands-trolley-jacks/halfords-5-piece-lifting-kit-657230.html) 


I was actually struggling to lift my mx5 up with just this as there aren't made good spots underneath the car to lift it from and the jack itself does not go that high up.



## Tool set: 
For now, I've bought this cheap set of ratchets from [amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/WORKPRO-Socket-Release-Ratchet-Mechanic/dp/B07B8Y1SNC)

When it comes to spanners, I have random pieces from working on bicycles over the years.

### HOWEVER
What I actually want to get, but for now its completely unnecessary and 4x the price of the kit above. Therefore could not justify it to myself for now.

It's the [150 piece set](https://www.halfords.com/tools/hand-tools/socket-sets/halfords-advanced-150-pc-socket-and-spanner-set-735906.html) or ratchets and spanners from Halfords Advanced brand.

The reason why I want this set is simply because it should be everything I ever need and Halfords Advanced brand has lifetime warranty... also in person it looks very pretty ðŸ‘€.
