Currently known issues with the car:
- Coolant leak from one of the hoses
- Battery keeps dying

<!--more-->

## Coolant leak
The coolant leak itself is not too bad, only leaking drops at a time.
However, the issue is the fact that its leaking onto the power steering (I think) belt, causing a massive squeal (sometimes) when the car is turned on, until the coolant on the belt evaporates.

Proposed fix. For now I might try and tape it/superglue it with something. However, I am planning to get a coloured silicone tube set to do a full swap of all of the tubing... make it look nice and pretty :)

## Battery keeps dying
Even after removing the wink mod, the battery kept going dead. The worse scenario was not being able to start the car even after just 2 hours after driving the car.
I am suspecting that I might be able to revive it with just charging the battery fully from a wall outlet. So I have ordered a wall charger.
Also because it is needed anyways, I have ordered a portable jump start power bank so I don't have to rely on anyone if I need to jump start.

If Charging the battery fully does not work then I will have to get a new battery. And I will get a `063` and possibly will need to get an adaptor bracket so it fits properly. 

### UPDATE
This has now been fixed with just a new battery :)
